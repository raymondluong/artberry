Trips to the museum are often isolated experiences â€“ visitors forget the artwork they viewed, cultural context they learned, and emotions they felt after leaving the museum.

Artberry is a museum scrapbook that helps visitors effortlessly record their moments in the museum, re-experience their visit after leaving, and learn more about their art taste over time.

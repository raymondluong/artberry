Trips to the museum are often isolated experiences â€“ visitors forget the artwork they viewed, cultural context they learned, and emotions they felt after leaving the museum.

Artberry is a museum scrapbook prototype that helps visitors effortlessly record their moments in the museum, re-experience their visit after leaving, and learn more about their art taste over time.

Our app was developed with React Native and Exponent for the CS147 Human-Computer Interaction Design course at Stanford University.

## Mobile Installation Instructions:
